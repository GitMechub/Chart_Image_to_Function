# Chart_Image_to_Function

## About Curve Extractor:

    **Curve Extractor** lets you upload any chart image or screenshot and turn it into usable data and a fitted mathematical function.
    
    You can erase axes, text, numbers, and noise using a simple brush tool, leaving only the curve.  
    The app then detects the curve pixels, converts them into XY points, and fits polynomial models to generate a clean mathematical representation.
    
    ## How It Works:
    
    1. **Upload an Image** of a plot or graph.  
    2. **Clean the Curve** by removing axes, labels, and unwanted elements.  
    3. **Extract Points** automatically from the remaining curve.  
    4. **Generate Polynomial Fits** and view equations and errors.  
    
    Use it to digitize curves from papers, PDFs, screenshots, or experimental plots quickly and accurately.
